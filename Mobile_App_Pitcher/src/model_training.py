# Raw Data: There are three raw data CSV files, which include social media data, news articles data, and company websites data.
# Data Format and Structure: The structure and format of the data requires preprocessing. It is in a tabular format, split into training and testing datasets.
# Target Variable: The target variable for this project is the app ideas generated by the machine learning model.
# Machine Learning Algorithm: The software will use a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to enable accurate data analysis and app idea generation. 
# Tensorflow will be used for building the machine learning model, a popular and powerful library for deep learning.
# Performance Metrics: 
# 1. Accuracy of the ML models in generating targeted mobile app ideas. 
# 2. Number of personalized app ideas generated per hour.
# 3, Number of angel investors engaged and follow-up communications facilitated
# 4. Success rate of funding applications submitted by app developers using the software
# 5. ROI of the app ideas generated by the software. 
# Libraries and Dependencies: Tensorflow will be used for building the machine learning model. 
# Data Preprocessing Steps: The preprocessing steps include data cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
# Hyperparameters: The hyperparameters of the ML model (learning rate, number of layers, and number of neurons per layer) are determined through experimentation.
# Method of Saving the Machine Learning Model: The machine learning model will be saved using the TensorFlow SavedModel format, which allows for easy deployment and reusability of the model.

# Load and preprocess the raw data

# Preprocess the data (e.g. data cleaning, normalization, feature engineering)
# ...

# Split the data into training and testing datasets
# ...

# Define the machine learning model

    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(1)
])

# Compile the model with an appropriate loss function and optimizer
model.compile(loss='mse', optimizer='adam', metrics=['mae'])

# Train the model with the training dataset and validate it with the testing dataset
model.fit(train_data, train_labels, epochs=10, validation_data=(test_data, test_labels))

# Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset using the specified performance metrics
# ...

# Save the trained model in the TensorFlow SavedModel format
model.save('data/models/machine_learning_model')
